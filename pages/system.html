                    <p>AppEx is a planning and reporting tool for anyone with coordinative responsibilities in a project (architects, general contractors, construction managers, owner representatives). AppEx can be deployed by individuals or firms of any size and allows the accumulation of personal or corporate knowledge.</p>                    
                    <p> AppEx operates on a customizable framework of project phases and construction/planning disciplines. This unique array perspective ensures that experiences from latter project phases are captured and turned into planning activities in preceding phases on future projects. For each phase and discipline users create planning worksheets with a blend of personal lessons and relevant lessons from a large database.</p>
                    <p>For reporting purposes an overview array shows at a glance the project status with activities that have been checked for quality and open issues.  This gives owners the assurance that lessons are being applied in the planning of activities and work products are checked for quality at every phase of a project. </p>
